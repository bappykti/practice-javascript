        <h1 class="display-5 text-center">Four most important Questions</h1>
        <h3 class="h3 my-3">Q.1 - Difference among var, let and const ?</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include:
            Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
            Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in
            their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
            Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to the
            immediate enclosing block.
            Let us now discuss, in detail, how these keywords can make a developers code more efficient and how to use
            each keyword to declare variables in JavaScript programs.</p>
        <h3 class="h3 my-3">Q.2 - Difference between arrow and regular function ? </h3>
        <p class="text-muted">Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this . The value of this inside an arrow
            function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this
            in the closest non-arrow parent function.</p>
        <h3 class="h3 my-3">Q.3 - Difference among map, forEach, filter and find ?</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">The forEach() method does not create a new array based on the given array. The map() method creates an
            entirely new array. The forEach() method returns “undefined“. The map() method returns the newly created
            array according to the provided callback function.The find() method is used to find all the descendant
            elements of the selected element. It finds the element in the DOM tree by traversing through the root to
            leaf. The filter() method is used to filters all the elements and returns the element that matches and the
            element that do not match are removed.</p>
        <h3 class="h3 my-3">Q.4 - Why use template string ?</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">You can use template strings to write your string exactly how you want it to appear, without all the
            quotation marks and confusion. Template strings make it very easy to spot a missing space and make your
            string more readable</p>
