    <title>Essential Q & A</title>

    <h1 class="text-center m-5">Four most important ustions and answers</h1>
    <h3>Q :- 1. Difference between local and session storage ?</h3>
    <p>Session Storage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>
    <h3>Q :- 2. Difference between global and block scope ?</h3>
    <p>In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the like.</p>
    <h3>Q :- 3. How javascript event loop works ?</h3>
    <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
    <h3>Q :- 4. How many ways to find undefine ?</h3>
    <p>undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined. In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it). A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned. Anything that lacks a description or is not declared is considered undefined. For example, in computer programming, if a variable is not declared when the program or script is run, you will receive a "no value," "not defined," "unbound," "undefined" error message.</p>
